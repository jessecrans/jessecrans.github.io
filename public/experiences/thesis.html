    For my bachelor thesis I performed large scale <em>data analysis</em> on archival data from the Chandra x-ray satellite, with the goal of finding Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) hidden amongst the data. Using an algorithm from <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/07/aa45912-23/aa45912-23.html" target="_blank">this paper</a>, which I adapted and improved to fit my specific goals. In total, I found 50 FXT candidates.
    <br /><br />
    During my internship I worked extensively with Python and more specifically the data handling framework Pandas, as well as with various APIs for retrieving the vast amounts of data needed to classify and verify the FXT candidates.
