    For my bachelor thesis I performed large scale <em>data analysis</em> on archival data from the Chandra x-ray satellite, with the goal of finding Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) hidden amongst the data. Using the algorithm from <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/07/aa45912-23/aa45912-23.html" target="_blank">Quirola-VÃ¡squez et al. 2022</a>, which I adapted and improved to fit my specific goals, I managed to find 50 FXT candidates of which 20 had been confirmed by previous work.
    <br /><br />
    During my internship I worked extensively with Python and more specifically the data handling framework Pandas, as well as with various APIs for retrieving the vast amounts of data needed to classify and verify the FXT candidates.
