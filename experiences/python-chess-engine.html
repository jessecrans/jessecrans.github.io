    I built a chess engine in Python using the Pygame library. It is a simple min-maxing type engine, primarly based on piece value, with some additional heatmaps for general piece placement guidance. I would estimate it to be around the 700-800 ELO range.

    Working on this project taught me how to structure such a large codebase; implement logic efficiently to maximise performance; and debug thoroughly to ensure the game functioning correctly.
